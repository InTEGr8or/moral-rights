Then there is the color-coded Blacks vs the Whites, or Reds vs Greens that supposedly represent demographic collectives. There are several more types of demographic campaigns.

This is a non-trivial issue.\nMost of us can easily side with the truth, while we sit in comfort, but we should seriously consider and understand that the schizm between truth and the good often arises from conditions of great adversity. Our aliegence to the truth is not really tested until great dificulties arise. That\u0026rsquo;s why we have to understand the problem from all angles because, at some point, we will be aproaching it from a different angle.\nThere can be no good that is not based on truth. The true is validated by what exists. A person can carry out a heinous act which is not good, but once they have committed that act all future truths and goods must derive from a world in which that injust act was committed.\nThe real world already presents scenarios which can occasionally make it dificult to accept the truth. It is already a desparate situation, because any failure to accept the truth immediately begins a detachment process with will require extra effort to overcome later. This is the process called \u0026ldquo;correction\u0026rdquo;, or becoming \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; with the true reality.\nMaintaining attachment to reality, to the truth, can be explored by comparing the sampling rates of driving video-games. Older video games with a slower refresh rate are more difficult to avoid crashing.\nThe need for \u0026ldquo;real time\u0026rdquo; feedback is a profound insite into man\u0026rsquo;s relationship with reality. \u0026ldquo;The truth\u0026rdquo; is not a single eternal diktat from the author of reality. It is a rich, high definition data-stream. There are \u0026ldquo;truths\u0026rdquo;, durable generalization that help us integrate new facts with previously ingested facts, but none of those can override the current data-stream.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/equality/","title":"Equality","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Equality is used widely and very often but in two opposed meanings, one right and the other everything else.\nThere is one and only one way in which equality as a general fact of life exists, and that is this: Everyone has one and only one life to live.\nThat is the only sense in which all humans are equal. It is true of all humans now, all humans that have ever existed, and all humans that will ever exist.\nIt is the context within which any policies, laws, or governmental and political structures should exist.\nCounterstatements To clarify the context of the singularity of life-ownership it is helpful to make several counterstatements.\nCounterstatements clarify a principle but telling us explicity what must not be true if the principle is true.\nThey are like a bet, saying that if any of these are ever found to be true, then this principle must be false. That makes the principle testable.\nIt also tells the ready what clarity of insight they can achieve by adopting the principle.\nNo one ever \u0026ldquo;took a life\u0026rdquo;. If someone claims to have or is accused of taking a life, ask them to show it to you. THey will not be able to produce it. The phrase \u0026ldquo;took a life\u0026rdquo; is, therefore, a whitewashing, an attempt at beautifying, a euphamism for the very real and very much more evil thing that the person did: they destroyed a life. Multi-life and multi-universe theory obscures this truth. Slavery is a deception. No one can take ownership of another person\u0026rsquo;s life.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to make the bold and outlandish claim here for the first time: the political right SHOULD MEAN ideas that are right about political science qua political science. There should be a right way to govern, or all knowledge is a blind scratching for grub. Somewhere, somehow there must be a better and a worse in politics, and the only way to attempt that is to define the scope of what might be called \u0026ldquo;the proper role of government\u0026rdquo;.\nOne must understand the purpose of an egocentric coordinate system like left and right when applied to moral/ethical/political judgment.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not to find the median between two extremities. It\u0026rsquo;s to separate the very large number of bad choices from the very small number of good ones.\nCounter Examples To know what a thing is it is helpful to know what a thing isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhenever learning what a thing is, a learner improves his understanding by looking at various entitities and saying \u0026ldquo;Is this the thing\u0026rdquo;\nFor instance, when learning the color green, a person will look around at the things around them and see if they can spot a green thing. This means they are seing many things and filtering out the not-green.\nThis is particularly important with higher-level abstractions such as rights. Higher-level abstractions are abstractions based on abstractions. The color green is a lower-level abstraction which is directly observable and learned by providing examples. Higher-level abstractions, such as \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hue\u0026rdquo; are built on prior abstractions such as \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;golden\u0026rdquo;. Higher-level abstractions are therefor more dificult to trace to their basis in reality. They can easily become detached when sufficient care is not applied.\nIn the case of rights, which is among the highest-level abstractions, people have made many errors.\nThere are a wide veriety of counter-examples to a rational concept of rights. A person, whether from lack of care or mallicious intent, can formulate a wide veriety of absurdities as their ideal formulation of rights. Here are a few:\nAn ethereal persona floats over the world and guides human behavior and destiny acording to that persona\u0026rsquo;s cherrished ideals. Satisfying that entity\u0026rsquo;s desires is the definition of what is good and right. An ethereal persona inhabits and animates the Earth planet and guides the activities of the Earth planet towards it\u0026rsquo;s cherrished intent. Satisfying that entity\u0026rsquo;s desires is the definition of what is good and right. An ethereal persona inhabits and animates a national land-mass of the chosen population to rule over all other populations to the cherished intent of that ethereal pesona. Satisfying that entity\u0026rsquo;s desires is the definition of what is good and right. An etherial persona inhabits and animates blood/bloodlines/DNA/RNA \u0026hellip; An ethereal persona inhabits and animates the universe \u0026hellip; An ethereal persona inhabits and animates history \u0026hellip; An ethereal persona inhabits and animates corn \u0026hellip; An ethereal persona inhabits and animates the perfest circle, or the number one, or a subatomic particle, or nothingness, etc \u0026hellip; As we can see, these misformulations have occured throughout history and right up until this very moment. They will likely still be possible in any untrained person at any moment in the future.\nHigher-level abstractions are easily subverted if diligence is not constantly applied.\nThe profound hazzard is that each one of this misformulations of rights can be use to violate real rights.\nIf a person or a group of people decide to put the Earth\u0026rsquo;s cherrished ideals as the definition of what is good and right, they will act acording to that corrupt reasoning and violate the actual rights of actual persons and humans without limit.\nWe have as proof many examples from the past of peaople putting the \u0026ldquo;rights\u0026rdquo; of the king, the nation, the state, the blood, and many so-called pagan deities above the rights of individual humans, and of them slaughtering those humans as a direct result. Many tragic less-than-lethal rights violations also occurred in larger numbers and were often direct precursors to the slaughter.\nThis is a non-trivial thinking problem.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/why-tech/","title":"Why Tech?","tags":[],"description":"","content":"A valid system of rights must be communicable.\nTo agree to a policy, that policy just be expressable in terms that are understandable and within the experience of a broad range of people.

They have to be workable and functional in those terms.\nA valid policy should be adopted, not just enforced.\nFor these reasons it cannot be expressed in terms of faith, because faith means trust in the unexpressable and unspecifiable.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/applying-rights/","title":"Applying Rights","tags":[],"description":"Rights are claims of universal principles for all moral actors and the foundation of all policy.","content":"Rights must be distinguished from arbitrary claims on declared needs. They cannot exist without a self-consistent statement on how they are to be established and applied.\nThe primary principle of rights is that they are self-adopting.\nThe principle of property implies that rights are applied where it is proper for them to be applied. within the pepper context and onto the proper range.\nThis, further, implies a method by with to deal with the improper policies: make them applied first onto their proponents.\nPeople who advocate the imposition of a policy should be challenged to show that they have first applied that policy onto themselves.\nThe first step is to state the policy, as I am doing in this document, and the second step is to demonstrate that it is good to first apply the policy onto the self, as I am advocating by publishing this document. This is the principle of political honesty.\nContinuing this transition from speculation to application of policy, improper policies should be persecutable. By the some a policy is applied broadly each proponent out the policy should have been asked to certify that they policy they wish to be applied onto others has first been applicable to themselves and applied into themselves, to show that it is a good policy, a valid policy. This should give ample time to make minute adjustments to the policy and to work through it in fine detail.\nAttempts to push through improper policies should be exposed early as improprieties and a direct reflection of the character of the proponent.\nState institutions which are currently in existence and which are found to be improper should be applied onto themselves to dismantle themselves.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/","title":"Moral Rights","tags":[],"description":"A technical specification for a foundation of minimal requirements of government","content":"Moral Rights Morality is the guide to action. It pertains only to human choices.\nIt is the study of what to do, and of judging what has been done.\nMorality is the higher-level topic of discerning right action from wrong action.\nIt is higher-level because it is an abstraction built on prior, more fundamental abstractions which it depends on, such as value, judgment, action, intent, and life. Politics is the higher-level abstract topic of coordinating moral judgment among a community of humans and encoding rules into laws.\nAll forms of governance and rule throughout history have been built upon a system of rights.\nThe Fundamental Observation of Rights There is a foundational observation and statement of fact that any rational system of rights must be based on and it is this:\nEach person has one and only one life to live.\nThis is the way in which we are all equal. This is the real meaning of the ideal of equality before the law.\nIt is a fact which all rights must be discussed within the context of. It is the constant context of any discussion of rights.\nEach individual has a life, the have only one life, and they are the only rightful and proper owner of that life. So it is also the foundation of any discussion of property.\nThe Good and The Bad The bad can only be judged in relation to some concept of the good, so we should start with a statement of the good.\nPeople survive by producing beneficial circumstance. An example is breathing. The intake of oxygen is necessary for the continuance of the decision-making process beyond a very limited timeframe, and so it serves as a good example. The inhalation of oxygen also only needs to occur for a short duration before effluent needs to be exhaled, there is a time-based decision-making component of judgment, and this is true of all decision making and all judgement. The value of inhalation it\u0026rsquo;s valuable too a particular person and for a particular duration.\nOld-world systems: Right to rule Devine right Mandate of heaven Majority Rule: the voice of the people Modified into Marxist/Bulshevik \u0026ldquo;dictatorship of the proletariat\u0026rdquo; Each of these theories of politics starts from the premise of establishing a \u0026ldquo;right to rule\u0026rdquo;.\nThat means they still depend on a moral justification of a right.\nThe problem is, none of them achieve the concept of right. They attempt to build a political system that are claimed to be based on a right, while at the same time violating that actual concept of a right.\nA right is a universal principle of what is right, so as to blame a violation of a write, which is called a wrong. If a man\u0026rsquo;s rights are violated, we say he was wronged.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t establish a universal system of rights by basing it on a right to violate other people\u0026rsquo;s rights. There can be no such right, since it would undermine the concept of right and wrong in general.\nThe Popularity of Populism It\u0026rsquo;s important to show the problems with democracy as an ideal, because it\u0026rsquo;s the most popular ideal in many ways.\nCountless books and articles focus on \u0026ldquo;The Threat to Democracy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Liberty vs Democracy\u0026rdquo; [citation needed]\nAdditionally, societal progress of privatly owned printing, production, and industry is labeld \u0026ldquo;The democratization of printing\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the democratization of production\u0026rdquo;, when, in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite of democratization. No one has to vote on what their private means of production will produce.\nDemocracy is not identical to liberty. Whenever a majority votes to violate the liberty of minorities, democracy is in opposition to liberty. At that point, democracy stands in opposition to rights.\nThe popular vote is not a moral principle.\nMany real-world examples are available: The National Socialist Party of the 1930s and \u0026rsquo;40s were popularly elected. Before them, the Soviet socialist \u0026ldquo;Bulshevek\u0026rdquo; had been popularly elected at one point, and took the name, which means \u0026ldquo;majority party\u0026rdquo;. And, of course, before either of those, the American Democratic Party used the popular vote to enslave minorities in the Democrat South. At that time, the Democratic Party was clear in their messaging that they favored \u0026ldquo;majority rule\u0026rdquo; over a system of individual rights, and they used that majority rule to build slave plantations and to start a war to preserve the institution of slavery.\nMistaking Populations for Principles Pretending that popular votes are principles has many adjacent affects. One of the biggest is mistaking populations for populations are principles.\nAny discussion of a moral principle in popular media is shure to spend a majority of it\u0026rsquo;s time referring to popular opinions of representative populations. When discussing the Right or the Left, news commentators will refer the the \u0026ldquo;new Left\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;alt right\u0026rdquo; or to \u0026ldquo;what the right is now\u0026rdquo; by referring to popularly elected officials, as if the popularly elected official defines what the principle is.\nTo clarify this point, I must state what a principle is.\nThe Principle of Populism Majority-rule is called out explicitly because it pervades politial thinking amongst advocates of the left and the right in the current day.\nIt is nearly impossible to discuss a political navigation system, or any political principles, without devolving into arguments over current public opinion with the implied assertion that that is what political distinctions are made out of.\nContra populism, the assertion of this document is that immutable political principles exist, and that it is important to discover, identify, recognize what they are.\nIt must be pointed out that this view against populism, against the rule by majority vote, is so contrary to generally accepted assumptions and language and narratives that it must be pointed out. There are many widely used idioms which make the assumption that majority opinion is sufficient justification for moral rightness. This document makes the assertion that moral rightness must be corrected by the few, perhaps the one, before it will be adopted by any general population.\nNew-world system: Individual rights Individual rights are rights to not be ruled. Left and Right: a fragile dichotomy Politics is about governance and governance is about laws, and laws are about distinguishing, judging, right from wrong.\nIt is not about estimating and satisfying the material needs of a population, or of deciding which population to favor over another population.\nThe \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; are often discussed as warring population of competing intents that must be balanced, one against the other, by a political system of checks and \u0026ldquo;balances\u0026rdquo;. The left/right dichotomy is described as two \u0026ldquo;wings\u0026rdquo; of a bird, which is often taken to be the great Golden Eagle of the national symbol.\nBut what kind of bird has wings which are at war with each other? How well does a bird fly whose wings are working against the intent of the other wing? That is not how birds work. Birds use their wings together.\nBut how much more destructive is the view of a great nation of nearly 400 million people to say they have only one head among them? That each person is merely a member, perhaps a feather, making no choices of their own and only obediently following the decisions made in the far awaay head controlled by others?\nHow has such a destructive image been placed into cultural currency?\nThe Problem Although all forms of governance in the world depend on a system of rights, they are all poorly defined.\nOld-world rights have been mostly discarded worldwide after the Declaration of Independence. Devine right reigned in July 1776, but now almost all governments of the world are some form of republic. That is a change unparalleled in world history.\nVague allusions to old-world rights persist, such as films like \u0026ldquo;The Kings Speech\u0026rdquo; in which the hero \u0026ldquo;finds his voice\u0026rdquo; to declare his right to rule, or in Chinese Communist Party claims to be \u0026ldquo;favored\u0026rdquo; by circumstance, or the Democrat Party adoration and elevation of \u0026ldquo;majority rule\u0026rdquo; as a foundational principle of the United States, even though they cite the affects of majority rule on minorites as \u0026ldquo;America\u0026rsquo;s original sin\u0026rdquo;.\nThe problem, the reason these obviously outmoded and outdated systems of rights still have any currency in modern civilization is because the system of individual rights rely almost entirely on the basis of \u0026ldquo;endowed by our creator\u0026rdquo;, an unnecissarily vague religious allusion.\nThe Solution This document sets out to establish on a solid foundation an objective system of rights and each of the requirments to formulate them into a valid and validatable government in absentia.\nThe primary goal is not to establish a government but to establish the requirements for a proper government and to provide a document to which candidates for governments can subscribe.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/speech-rights/","title":"Speech Rights","tags":[],"description":"Rights are a public proclaimation of policy statements and cannot exist with the right to make such statements.","content":"Speech rights are too often couched within a framework of allowing a person to tell others what they think.\nThat is certainly a component of speech rights, especially in any supposed democracy, but it is far from the only consideration or concern.\nThe Three Needs of Speech Rights The right to hear speech of others. The right to speak self-formulated truth statements to other people or populations of people. The value of speach within a society is that it provides a method to achieve common knowledge with others, so that your successful understandings can be replicated and amplified in others and by others. The right to have your self-formulated truth statements error-checked by others. The act of pronouncing aloud is so important and potent to troubleshooting that it is given a name \u0026ldquo;rubber ducky\u0026rdquo; troubleshooting, and it often works even when no listener is present. Constructing criticism of your stated articulations by others is a primary source of instruction. The Lie of Collective Consciousness Advocates of \u0026ldquo;collective consciousness\u0026rdquo; undermine all three of these rights, which are the bases of individual minds. The real goal of \u0026ldquo;collective consciousness\u0026rdquo; is not to allow selves to integrate. It is an attempt to integrate them by denying the existence of selves, by obliterating the \u0026ldquo;theory of mind\u0026rdquo; of others.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/disorientation/","title":"Disorientation","tags":[],"description":"The subversion of moral coordinates","content":"People complain every day about the loss of moral-political coordinates:\n\u0026ldquo;Left and right don\u0026rsquo;t mean anything anymore.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Both parties are the same, and both sides do that.\u0026rdquo; And yet articles are continually published and popularly read analyzing results and opinions based on \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; states, cities and regions.\nPeople continually think and reason about differences because politics is about differentiation.
