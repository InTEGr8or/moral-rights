They cannot exist without a self-consistent statement on how they are to be established and applied.\nThe primary principle of rights is that they are self-adopting.\nThe principle of property implies that rights are applied where it is proper for them to be applied. within the pepper context and onto the proper range.\nThis, further, implies a method by with to deal with the improper policies: make them applied first onto their proponents.\nPeople who advocate the imposition of a policy should be challenged to show that they have first applied that policy onto themselves.\nThe first step is to state the policy, as I am doing in this document, and the second step is to demonstrate that it is good to first apply the policy onto the self, as I am advocating by publishing this document. This is the principle of political honesty.\nContinuing this transition from speculation to application of policy, improper policies should be persecutable. By the some a policy is applied broadly each proponent out the policy should have been asked to certify that they policy they wish to be applied onto others has first been applicable to themselves and applied into themselves, to show that it is a good policy, a valid policy. This should give ample time to make minute adjustments to the policy and to work through it in fine detail.\nAttempts to push through improper policies should be exposed early as improprieties and a direct reflection of the character of the proponent.\nState institutions which are currently in existence and which are found to be improper should be applied onto themselves to dismantle themselves.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/","title":"Moral Rights","tags":[],"description":"A technical specification for a foundation of minimal requirements of government","content":"Moral Rights Morality is the guide to action.\nIt is the study of what to do, and of judging what has been done.\nMorality is the higher-level topic of discerning right action from wrong action.\n It is higher-level because it is an abstraction built on prior, more fundamental abstractions which it depends on, such as value, judgment, action, intent, and life.  Politics is the higher-level abstract topic of coordinating moral judgment among a community of humans and encoding rules into laws.\nAll forms of governance and rule throughout history have been built upon a system of rights.\nThe Fundamental Observation of Rights There is a foundational observation and statement of fact that any rational system of rights must be based on and it is this:\nEach person has one and only one life to live.\nThis is the way in which we are all equal. This is the real meaning of the ideal of equality before the law.\nIt is a fact which all rights must be discussed within the context of. It is the constant context of any discussion of rights.\nEach individual has a life, the have only one life, and they are the only rightful and proper owner of that life. So it is also the foundation of any discussion of property.\nOld-world systems: Right to rule  Devine right Mandate of heaven Majority Rule: the voice of the people  Modified into Marxist/Bulshevik \u0026ldquo;dictatorship of the proletariat\u0026rdquo;    Each of these theories of politics starts from the premise of establishing a \u0026ldquo;right to rule\u0026rdquo;.\nThat means they still depend on a moral justification of a right.\nThe problem is, none of them achieve the concept of right. They attempt to build a political system that are claimed to be based on a right, while at the same time violating that actual concept of a right.\nA right is a universal principle of what is right, so as to blame a violation of a write, which is called a wrong. If a man\u0026rsquo;s rights are violated, we say he was wronged.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t establish a universal system of rights by basing it on a right to violate other people\u0026rsquo;s rights. There can be no such right, since it would undermine the concept of right and wrong in general.\nThe Popularity of Populism It\u0026rsquo;s important to show the problems with democracy as an ideal, because it\u0026rsquo;s the most popular ideal in many ways.\nCountless books and articles focus on \u0026ldquo;The Threat to Democracy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Liberty vs Democracy\u0026rdquo; [citation needed]\nAdditionally, societal progress of privatly owned printing, production, and industry is labeld \u0026ldquo;The democratization of printing\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the democratization of production\u0026rdquo;, when, in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite of democratization. No one has to vote on what their private means of production will produce.\nThe Principle of Populism Majority-rule is called out explicitly because it pervades politial thinking amongst advocates of the left and the right in the current day.\nIt is nearly impossible to discuss a political navigation system, or any political principles, without devolving into arguments over current public opinion with the implied assertion that that is what political distinctions are made out of.\nContra populism, the assertion of this document is that immutable political principles exist, and that it is important to discover, identify, recognize what they are.\nIt must be pointed out that this view against populism, against the rule by majority vote, is so contrary to generally accepted assumptions and language and narratives that it must be pointed out. There are many widely used idioms which make the assumption that majority opinion is sufficient justification for moral rightness. This document makes the assertion that moral rightness must be corrected by the few, perhaps the one, before it will be adopted by any general population.\nNew-world system: Individual rights  Individual rights are rights to not be ruled.  Left and Right: a fragile dichotomy Politics is about governance and governance is about laws, and laws are about distinguishing, judging, right from wrong.\nThe Problem Although all forms of governance in the world depend on a system of rights, they are all poorly defined.\nOld-world rights have been mostly discarded worldwide after the Declaration of Independence. Devine right reigned in July 1776, but now almost all governments of the world are some form of republic. That is a change unparalleled in world history.\nVague allusions to old-world rights persist, such as films like \u0026ldquo;The Kings Speech\u0026rdquo; in which the hero \u0026ldquo;finds his voice\u0026rdquo; to declare his right to rule, or in Chinese Communist Party claims to be \u0026ldquo;favored\u0026rdquo; by circumstance, or the Democrat Party adoration and elevation of \u0026ldquo;majority rule\u0026rdquo; as a foundational principle of the United States, even though they cite the affects of majority rule on minorites as \u0026ldquo;America\u0026rsquo;s original sin\u0026rdquo;.\nThe problem, the reason these obviously outmoded and outdated systems of rights still have any currency in modern civilization is because the system of individual rights rely almost entirely on the basis of \u0026ldquo;endowed by our creator\u0026rdquo;, an unnecissarily vague religious allusion.\nThe Solution This document sets out to establish on a solid foundation an objective system of rights and each of the requirments to formulate them into a valid and validatable government in absentia.\nThe primary goal is not to establish a government but to establish the requirements for a proper government and to provide a document to which candidates for governments can subscribe.\n"},{"uri":"https://moralrights.tech/speech-rights/","title":"Speech Rights","tags":[],"description":"Rights are a public proclaimation of policy statements and cannot exist with the right to make such statements.","content":"The Three Needs of Speech Rights  The right to hear speech of others.

The Lie of Collective Consciousness Advocates of \u0026ldquo;collective consciousness\u0026rdquo; undermine all three of these rights, which are the bases of individual minds. The real goal of \u0026ldquo;collective consciousness\u0026rdquo; is not to allow selves to integrate.
