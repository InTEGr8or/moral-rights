Any discussion about politics must acknowlege that some portion of the must have a beligerent agenda.

We know that people make war. We must not assume that wars always happen by accident, or as the result of a misunderstanding between two peoples.

Some of them must be the product of a prior, internal, misunderstanding held by one of the beligerents: the belief that he benefits by war-making.
