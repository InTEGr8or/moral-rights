People complain every day about the loss of moral-political coordinates:

* "Left and right don't mean anything anymore."
* "Both parties are the same, and both sides do that."

And yet articles are continually published and popularly read analyzing results and opinions based on "red" and "blue" states, cities and regions.

People continually think and reason about differences because politics _is about_ differentiation. The entire realm of political thought is about differentiation: outlawing some activities while making provisions for others. Politics _is not_ indiscriminate.

If you eliminate differentiation, you eliminate politics. You may still have force and violence, but it will have nothing to do with any system of rational organization.
