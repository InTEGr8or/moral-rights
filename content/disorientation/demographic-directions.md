THe main flaw of Democratic ideology is the theory of demographic direction. Political campaigns are framed in terms of directions. The North vs the South, the East vs the West. Those are the geocentric discriminators of the "moral compass" political campains. Then there is the color-coded Blacks vs the Whites, or Reds vs Greens that supposedly represent demographic collectives. There are several more types of demographic campaigns. The real, everlasting political discriminator is based on a moral discriminator of Rights vs Wrongs, and that should be expressed in an always-available egocentric coordinate: what is Right and what should be Left.
