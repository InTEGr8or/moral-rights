In a political culture motivated by pupular opinion, such as one dominated by democracy, the illusion that the majority of people know what the majority of people think is a deceptive illusion. Most people and estimate the opinions of about 140 other people. There is a deliberately promoted deception that because a person is part of a majority, they are therefor in touch with the mind of the majority. This deception is popularized any time a single man is asked to represent the ideas of a large group of men. The mass media news clergy steps in to support this deception as often as possible, with popularly named organizations such as the 'Mirror', or 'The Times'. The image is clear, that the news organizations, by gathering opinion from diverse sources, can represent and unvarnished Mirror of the Times, or the ideas of the times, or the current 'Zeitgeist'. There are an abundance of terms that are used to support this idea in literature and common usage.
