Equality is used widely and very often but in two opposed meanings, one right and the other everything else.

There is one and only one way in which equality as a general fact of life exists, and that is this: Everyone has one and only one life to live.

That is the only sense in which all humans are equal. It is true of all humans now, all humans that have ever existed, and all humans that will ever exist.

It is the context within which any policies, laws, or governmental and political structures should exist.

## Counterstatements

To clarify the context of the singularity of life-ownership it is helpful to make several counterstatements.

Counterstatements clarify a principle but telling us explicity _what must not be true_ if the principle is true.

They are like a bet, saying that if any of these are ever found to be true, then this principle must be false. That makes the principle _testable_.

It also tells the ready what clarity of insight they can achieve by adopting the principle.

1. No one ever "took a life".
   1. If someone claims to have or is accused of taking a life, ask them to show it to you. THey will not be able to produce it.
   2. The phrase "took a life" is, therefore, a whitewashing, an attempt at beautifying, a euphamism for the very real and very much more evil thing that the person did: they _destroyed_ a life. Multi-life and multi-universe theory obscures this truth.
2. Slavery is a deception. 
   1. No one can take ownership of another person's life.
   2. The property relation of the self-ownership of a life belongs to the one who lives it and will experience it's terminus.
