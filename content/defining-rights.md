The goal of political science is to find good methods of governance, not just to divide the world 50/50 to achieve balance.

The Right I define as the liberalism of the founding fathers and the enlightenment, but only the good party of that: individual rights, s government of laws and policies without personal or collective privilege.

being right is an achievement
This is obviously true of I'm talking about getting all the answers right on a test
It SHOULD also be true for any political science or political thought. I'm going to make the bold and outlandish claim here for the first time: the political right SHOULD MEAN ideas that are right about political science qua political science. There should be a right way to govern, or all knowledge is a blind scratching for grub.
Somewhere, somehow there must be a better and a worse in politics, and the only way to attempt that is to define the scope of what might be called "the proper role of government".


One must understand the purpose of an egocentric coordinate system like left and right when applied to moral/ethical/political judgment.

It's not to find the median between two extremities. It's to separate the very large number of bad choices from the very small number of good ones.
