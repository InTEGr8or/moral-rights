## The Three Needs of Speech Rights

1. The right to hear speech of others.
2. The right to speak self-formulated truth statements.
3. The right to have your self-formulated truth statements error-checked by others.

## The Lie of Collective Consciousness

Advocates of "collective consciousness" undermine all three of these rights, which are the bases of individual minds. The real goal of "collective consciousness" is not to allow selves to integrate. It is an attempt to integrate them by denying the existence of selves, by obliterating the "theory of mind" of others.
