A valid system of rights must be communicable.

To agree to a policy, that policy just be expressable in terms that are understandable and within the experience of a broad range of people. It should be expressed in terms which are understood by everyone.

They don't just have to be expressive in those terms. They have to be workable and functional in those terms.

A valid policy should be adopted, not just enforced.

For these reasons it cannot be expressed in terms of faith, because faith means trust in the unexpressable and unspecifiable.
