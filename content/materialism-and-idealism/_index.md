Most wrong-thinking starts off by an attempt at right-thinking. This is how materialism became idealized.

A consciencious investigator looks at many ideas that competed with reality. There are many ideas throughout history that infamuosly opposed reality _and lost_.

The investigator, this is anyone who thinks criticaly about ideas, sets up a comparison with reality in one column and ideas in the other. They notice that when ideas oppose reality, those ideas will eventualy fail, without exception.

The investigator looks at the failure rate in the battle between ideas and reality and concludes that ideas are impotent when posed _against_ reality.

He therefor concludes that _ideas don't matter_.

But there are a pair of problems here. 

The first arrises from a bug. It could be called a "code smell". This is an anti-pattern in the thinking process which is at the root of the cognative corruption and destruction. 

1. It is the acceptance of the idea that an idea which is opposed to reality can have _any_ value.

Counterstatement: Ideas in opposition to reality _must_ be rejected.

The anti-pattern which is cognatively destructive and should be guarded against in all of it's many manifestations, and there are _many_.
