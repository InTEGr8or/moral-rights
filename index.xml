Political campaigns are framed in terms of directions. The North vs the South, the East vs the West. Those are the geocentric discriminators of the &amp;ldquo;moral compass&amp;rdquo; political campains. Then there is the color-coded Blacks vs the Whites, or Reds vs Greens that supposedly represent demographic collectives. There are several more types of demographic campaigns. The real, everlasting political discriminator is based on a moral discriminator of Rights vs Wrongs, and that should be expressed in an always-available egocentric coordinate: what is Right and what should be Left.</description></item><item><title>Defining Rights</title><link>https://moralrights.tech/defining-rights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moralrights.tech/defining-rights/</guid><description>The goal of political science is to find good methods of governance, not just to divide the world 50/50 to achieve balance.
The Right I define as the liberalism of the founding fathers and the enlightenment, but only the good party of that: individual rights, s government of laws and policies without personal or collective privilege.
Being right is an achievement.
This is obviously true of I&amp;rsquo;m talking about getting all the answers right on a test It SHOULD also be true for any political science or political thought.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://moralrights.tech/disorientation/timeline-of-democrat-fascism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moralrights.tech/disorientation/timeline-of-democrat-fascism/</guid><description>Timeline of Democrat Fascism Outlaw guns fix prices New Deal economic tyrrany segregation persecute journalists property forfiture concentration camps rounding up into &amp;ldquo;reservations&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://moralrights.tech/news/posts/2022-18-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moralrights.tech/news/posts/2022-18-19/</guid><description>The popular assumption is that a political ideal is represented by the center of mass of the people who claim to subscribe to it.
That would make the theory untestable. It would only be pollable, and the representation would be in continual drift.
Real ideals are testable and have some unchanging basis which can be validated or invalidated.
This is how math, engineering, science, technology and all the things that are widely known for actually working work.</description></item><item><title>Disorientation Agenda</title><link>https://moralrights.tech/disorientation/disorientation-agenda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moralrights.tech/disorientation/disorientation-agenda/</guid><description>Any discussion about politics must acknowlege that some portion of the must have a beligerent agenda.
We know that people make war. We must not assume that wars always happen by accident, or as the result of a misunderstanding between two peoples.
Some of them must be the product of a prior, internal, misunderstanding held by one of the beligerents: the belief that he benefits by war-making.</description></item></channel></rss>
