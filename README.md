<title>Moral Rights</title>

# A technical specification for a foundation of minimal requirements of government

All forms of governance and rule throughout history have been built upon a system of rights.

## Old-world systems: Right to rule

- Devine right
- Mandate of heaven
- Majority Rule: the voice of the people
    - Modified into Marxist/Bulshevik "dictatorship of the proletariat"

### The Principle of Populism

Majority-rule is called out explicitly because it pervades politial thinking amongst advocates of the left and the right in the current day.

It is nearly impossible to discuss a political navigation system, or any political principles, without devolving into arguments over current public opinion with the implied assertion that that is what political distinctions _are made out of_.

Contra populism, the assertion of this document is that immutable political principles exist, and that it is important to discover, identify, recognize what they are.


## New-world system: Individual rights

- Individual rights, the right to not be ruled.

## The Problem

Although all forms of governance in the world depend on a system of rights, they are all poorly defined.

Old-world rights have been mostly discarded worldwide after the Declaration of Independence. Devine right reigned in July 1776, but now almost all governments of the world are some form of republic. That is a change unparalleled in world history.

Vague allusions to old-world rights persist, such as films like "The Kings Speech" in which the hero "finds his voice" to declare his right to rule, or in Chinese Communist Party claims to be "favored" by circumstance, or the Democrat Party adoration and elevation of "majority rule" as a foundational principle of the United States, even though they cite the affects of majority rule on minorites as "America's original sin".

The problem, the reason these obviously outmoded and outdated systems of rights still have any currency in modern civilization is because the system of individual rights rely almost entirely on the basis of "endowed by our creator", an unnecissarily vague religious allusion.

## The Solution

This document sets out to establish on a solid foundation an objective system of rights and each of the requirments to formulate them into a valid and validatable government in absentia.

The primary goal is not to establish a government but to establish the requirements for a proper government and to provide a document to which candidates for governments can subscribe.
