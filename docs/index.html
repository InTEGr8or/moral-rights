<h2 id=a-technical-specification-for-a-foundation-of-minimal-requirements-of-government>A technical specification for a foundation of minimal requirements of government</h2>
<p>Morality is the guide to action. It is the study of what to do, and of judging what has been done.</p>
<p>Morality is the higher-level topic of discerning right action from wrong action.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is higher-level because it is an abstraction <em>built on</em> prior, more fundamental abstractions which it depends on, such as value, judgment, action, intent, and life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Politics is the higher-level abstract topic of coordinating moral judgment among a community of humans and encoding rules into laws.</p>
<p>All forms of governance and rule throughout history have been built upon a system of rights.</p>
<h2 id=old-world-systems-right-to-rule>Old-world systems: Right to rule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Devine right</li>
<li>Mandate of heaven</li>
<li>Majority Rule: the voice of the people
<ul>
<li>Modified into Marxist/Bulshevik &ldquo;dictatorship of the proletariat&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these theories of politics starts from the premise of establishing a &ldquo;right to rule&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That means they still depend on a moral justification of a right.</p>
<p>The problem is, none of them achieve the concept of right. They attempt to build a political system that are claimed to be based on a right, while at the same time violating that actual concept of a right.</p>
<p>A right is a universal principle of what is right, so as to blame a violation of a write, which is called a <em>wrong</em>. If a man&rsquo;s rights are violated, we say he was wronged.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t establish a universal system of rights by basing it on a right to violate other people&rsquo;s rights. There can be no such right, since it would undermine the concept of right and wrong in general.</p>
<h3 id=the-popularity-of-populism>The Popularity of Populism</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to show the problems with democracy as an ideal, because it&rsquo;s the most popular ideal in <em>many</em> ways.</p>
<p>Countless books and articles focus on &ldquo;The Threat to Democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liberty vs Democracy&rdquo; [citation needed]</p>
<p>Additionally, societal progress of privatly owned printing, production, and industry is labeld &ldquo;The democratization of printing&rdquo; and &ldquo;the democratization of production&rdquo;, when, in fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite of democratization. No one has to vote on what their private means of production will produce.</p>
<h3 id=the-principle-of-populism>The Principle of Populism</h3>
<p>Majority-rule is called out explicitly because it pervades politial thinking amongst advocates of the left and the right in the current day.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to discuss a political navigation system, or any political principles, without devolving into arguments over current public opinion with the implied assertion that that is what political distinctions <em>are made out of</em>.</p>
<p>Contra populism, the assertion of this document is that immutable political principles exist, and that it is important to discover, identify, recognize what they are.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that this view against populism, against the rule by majority vote, is so contrary to generally accepted assumptions and language and narratives that it must be pointed out. There are many widely used idioms which make the assumption that majority opinion is sufficient justification for moral rightness. This document makes the assertion that moral rightness must be corrected by the few, perhaps the one, before it will be adopted by any general population.</p>
<h2 id=new-world-system-individual-rights>New-world system: Individual rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Individual rights, the right to not be ruled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=left-and-right-a-fragile-dichotomy>Left and Right: a fragile dichotomy</h2>
<p>Politics is about governance and governance is about laws, and laws are about distinguishing, judging, right from wrong.</p>
<h2 id=the-problem>The Problem</h2>
<p>Although all forms of governance in the world depend on a system of rights, they are all poorly defined.</p>
<p>Old-world rights have been mostly discarded worldwide after the Declaration of Independence. Devine right reigned in July 1776, but now almost all governments of the world are some form of republic. That is a change unparalleled in world history.</p>
<p>Vague allusions to old-world rights persist, such as films like &ldquo;The Kings Speech&rdquo; in which the hero &ldquo;finds his voice&rdquo; to declare his right to rule, or in Chinese Communist Party claims to be &ldquo;favored&rdquo; by circumstance, or the Democrat Party adoration and elevation of &ldquo;majority rule&rdquo; as a foundational principle of the United States, even though they cite the affects of majority rule on minorites as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s original sin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The problem, the reason these obviously outmoded and outdated systems of rights still have any currency in modern civilization is because the system of individual rights rely almost entirely on the basis of &ldquo;endowed by our creator&rdquo;, an unnecissarily vague religious allusion.</p>
<h2 id=the-solution>The Solution</h2>
<p>This document sets out to establish on a solid foundation an objective system of rights and each of the requirments to formulate them into a valid and validatable government in absentia.</p>
<p>The primary goal is not to establish a government but to establish the requirements for a proper government and to provide a document to which candidates for governments can subscribe.</p>

</a>
<p class=lead>
<em>
Rights are claims of universal principles for all moral actors and the foundation of all policy.
</em>
</p>
<div class=article-summary>Rights must be distinguished from arbitrary claims on declared needs. They cannot exist without a self-consistent statement on how they are to be established and applied.
The primary principle of rights is that they are self-adopting.
The principle of property implies that rights are applied where it is proper for them to be applied. within the pepper context and onto the proper range.
This, further, implies a method by with to deal with the improper policies: make them applied first onto their proponents.</div>

<em>
Rights are a public proclaimation of policy statements and cannot exist with the right to make such statements.
</em>
</p>
<div class=article-summary>The Three Needs of Speech Rights The right to hear speech of others. The right to speak self-formulated truth statements. The right to have your self-formulated truth statements error-checked by others. The Lie of Collective Consciousness Advocates of &ldquo;collective consciousness&rdquo; undermine all three of these rights, which are the bases of individual minds. The real goal of &ldquo;collective consciousness&rdquo; is not to allow selves to integrate. It is an attempt to integrate them by denying the existence of selves, by obliterating the &ldquo;theory of mind&rdquo; of others.</div>
